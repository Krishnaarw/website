                            <li>👨🏼‍⚕️I studied medicine for 6 years at Cambridge University, graduating in 2018 before
                                working in the UK’s National Health Service for 2 years.</li>
                            <li>🎬 I started my YouTube channel in 2017 making videos about medicine and studying. Now I
                                make videos about discussing ideas, books, tech and how we can live healthier, happier
                                lives.</li>
                            <li>💌 I write a weekly newsletter called Sunday Snippets. Every Sunday, I share my thoughts
                                with over 180,000 subscribers. I usually share my thoughts on subjects I’ve been
                                pondering, links to books I like, articles and podcasts I’ve enjoyed, and other rambly
                                stuff. You can check out previous issues here.</li>
                            <li>🎙 My brother and I host a weekly podcast called Not Overthinking. In each episode, we
                                talk about topics related to ‘happiness, creativity and the human condition’.</li>
                            <li>🎙 I host a second podcast, Deep Dive. On this podcast, we delve into the minds of
                                entrepreneurs, creators and other inspiring people to uncover the philosophies,
                                strategies and tools that help us live happier, healthier and more productive lives.

                            <li>✍️ On this website, I write articles about productivity, entrepreneurship and generic
                                life advice that I’ve found helpful over the years. As well as sharing my favourite apps
                                and tech.</li>
