                    Hey there 😀 I’m Krishna, I'm a 16-year-old student currently in 11th standard. I have a passion
                    for economics, history, and polity and aspire to become a successful lawyer in the future. In my
                    free time, I enjoy playing badminton, reading novels, and exploring the exciting world of AI.
                    Thanks for stopping by my website!

                            👩‍💻I have been coding since the age of 13. Starting with Python, I also know HTML and
                            CSS. As a matter of fact, this website is made by me with a bit of help from ChatGPT.

                            😛I don't have anything else to write. I just want to add this line to make 'Facts'
                            plural. Lol.
